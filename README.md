## **Planning**

### **Site Owner Goals**

- As a Programmer, I want to build up my Phython skills
- As a Game Creator, I want to produce a meaningful game that deals with moral choices 

### **User Stories**

- As a player, I want to be morally challenged and make though choices
- As a player, I want to play games that have a lasting impact
- As a player, I want to play as a border guard in passport control 

## **Features**

**Border Crossing** is a small textgame, made in Phython, about moral choices and consequences. 

The player takes the position of a new border guard officer at the border between two -unnamed-, fictitious countries. 

Both countries have a long and bloody history and only recently achieved peace.

Borders are now open, but animosities are still great within both countries, so everything could set off a diplomatic incident. 

The player has to make a decsision on who he lets into the country and who he rejects. 

Sometimes, there are secret outcomes, by asking the right questions. 

#### **Used Technologies**

- **Python:** Python 3.13.1

#### Design

The Design is completely set 

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- Manual testing was used during the entire development process by me (the Creator) and at least five other persons. 
- "Man-of-street" everybody who came by my flat was asked to play a round 
- A friend programmer helped with identifying bugs
- Testing was done in Chrome and Edge browser

### Validation and Issues

#### Python 3.13.1

#### PEP8 Linter

**Result: No errors found.**

However, the validation returned 29 Warnings in regards to either ES6 Version or the Mozilla Browser.

## Bugs

No known defects remaining.

## **Deployment**

Code Institutes Guidlines for deployments are used and recommended:

1. Open the [repository](https://github.com/askavian/border) 
2. Heroku was set up and configured to the standards given by the CI
3. In Heroku python interpreter was included in the settings `heroku/python`
4. In Heroku nodejs was included in the settings `heroku/nodejs`
5. For Browser Vies Configs are configured as follows: Included in _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000` 
5. The github repository is connected to the Heroku deployment. Automatic deployments are activated in settings, but final deployment is manually triggered

## Version Control
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) is used for Version Control.
* There is only a single branch **main** used.
* The entire code is stored in run.py

## Development Process and Commands

- Using the template provide by Code Institute as basis [githup template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template).  
- I used VSCode and via GitPod and tried to maintain **meningfull** and regular commits (i.e. features, bugs fixes, etc...). 
- Sometimes commits where commited as **testing** if the code was too small to count as a regular commit but I needed to test something in Heroku.
- Each Git Commit deployes after a short delay directly als to Heroku.

## Clone and Fork the Repository

You can easily clone or fork the **Border Crossing** repository to make changes or use it as a reference. Follow the steps below based on your operating system:

#### **Fork the Repository**

1. Visit the repository on GitHub: [Border Crossing](https://github.com/askavian/border).  
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner to create your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

#### **Clone the Repository**

The repository has a single branch, with code committed sequentially for clarity. It can be forked or cloned for further development.

## Future Enhancements

To further improve the typing game, I would add the following features:

- **More Content:** Include more Cases (up to 30).
- **Textflow:** Finetune the textflow so it comes more naturally.
- **Difficulty Level:** Finetune time settings and case numbers to enhance LoD.
- **Pictures:** Include more ASCII Art (i.e. Pictures of individuals).
- **Highscore:** Include a Highscore with user names.
- **Music:** Include Background Music for Ambience.

- My friend Ivy (fellow stundent from CI) for helping with the idea and talking when needed. [Ivy's Github](https://github.com/Ivrigy).
- Code Institute Students and Alumnis for Phython. 
- bbtong for a great YouTube Tutorial series. I took inspiration for file structure and especially how to handle text output so that is flows naturally and does not print all at once [bbtong's text rpg](https://github.com/bbtong/python-text-rpg/blob/master/exampleTextRPG.py).
- The 40k Name Generator to create completely outlandish names so that the game is completely fictional [Warhammer 40.000 Name Generator](https://www.realmofplastic.com/warhammer-40k-blog/imperial-citizens-40k-character-name-generator).
